This project has been independently undertaken by me (Kymmy), aimed at building a full-stack web app using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js).

## Getting Started

Create a user account today to find your perfect coach! Browse the homepage to explore available coaches and book your sessions.

To schedule a class, simply click on an availability in a coach's profile and then hit the 'Book' button, and keep track of your upcoming classes on your user dashboard.

As a coach, create an account and start managing your availability by scheduling events in the calendar.

Keep your schedule up-to-date by using the 'Update' button, or cancel sessions as needed with the 'Delete' button to keep your clients informed and engaged.

If a coach cancels a class with participants already booked, an email notification will be sent to all attendees, informing them of the cancellation.
