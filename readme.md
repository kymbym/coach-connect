This project has been independently undertaken by me (Kymmy), aimed at building a full-stack web app using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js).

## Getting Started

Create a user account today to find your perfect coach! Browse the homepage to explore available coaches and book your sessions.

To schedule a class, simply click on an availability in a coach's profile and then hit the 'Book' button, and keep track of your upcoming classes on your user dashboard.

As a coach, create an account and start managing your availability by scheduling events in the calendar.

Keep your schedule up-to-date by using the 'Update' button, or cancel sessions as needed with the 'Delete' button to keep your clients informed and engaged.

If a coach cancels a class with participants already booked, an email notification will be sent to all attendees, informing them of the cancellation.

## Next Steps

***This project is still a work in progress (WIP), and there are many next steps to work towards. This represents just version 1 of the application***

- Implement notifications or alert for when class bookings reach maximum capacity
- Display bookings on the coach dashboard under each specific availability
- Allow users to view all their bookings under each specific coach
- Prevent coaches from reducing the maximum number of participants below the current number of bookings, with an alert for this condition
- Update calendar colors based on different sports, etc
- Filtering options by sport, coach name, and sorting availabilities
- Add a bio section to the Coach Card
- Allow users to reschedule and cancel their bookings, ensuring changes reflect on the coach profile
- Ensure that changes to maximum participants are accurately reflected
